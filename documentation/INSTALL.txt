Installation of Eepohs Estpay Magento extension

This page describes Estpay installation for Magento.
As you can see, it’s quite straightforward but some tips may be helpful.
It is assumed that you have a fully working Magento installed before you start installation of Estpay.
Estpay extension requires at least Magento version 1.5.

Let's call your website your.magento-site.com. Replace it with fully qualified name of your website.

   1. Extract the Estpay_<version_number>.zip archive to a temporary folder. This is your $source folder. Your Magento installation folder is your $destination folder.
   2. Copy files and folders from $source/app folder to $destination/app folder. It is important to copy all included subfolders and their structure!
   3. Copy files and folders from $source/skin to $destination/skin folder. It’s important to retain the structure here as well!
   4. Copy files and folders from $source/js to $destination/js folder. It’s important to retain the structure here as well!
   5. Now remove your Magento cache from $destination/var/cache/ (delete all files and subfolders from that folder).
   6. Open your Magento admin and go to System->Configuration->Payment Methods. You should see Eepohs Estpay payment methods there.
   7. Configure your Estpay. The fields should be self-explanatory.
   8. Copy your private key and public keys of the banks to respective fields under Payment methods configuration. Note - it is very important to keep your private key safe!
